# One Part of a Big Clock #

This project consists of one large clock, to which each student adds a mechanism.

## Theme ##
### My Theme Ideas ###

#### The Traveller ####
Mechanisms depict what we do when travelling, such as walking with a backpack on, sitting on a train/plane, sipping something in a cafe, taking a photograph of some monument, etc. This would be one clock, perhaps deconstructed (numbers spread out and light up around different form than traditional clock) with twelve mechanisms.

#### Apocoalypse ####
Mechanisms depict different versions of the end of the world, such as nuclear war, famine, overpopulation, sun flare, etc. This could a similar clock to idea 1, but it could also be a build up at 15 minute intervals to a different cataclysm event every hour.

#### The Orchestra ####
Mechanisms depict different instruments come to life, Beauty-in-the-Beast style.

### Chosen Theme ###
Self representaiton through hobbies: each student depicts themself through a mechanism depicting a hobby they enjoy.
