# Midterm #

Container for all things related to my midterm project for Machine Lab.

## Concept Description ##
A 3D (or 4D?) model of a mapped self-concept. The blocks are different mental representations of reality that constitute an individual's self. These representations can be understood as those items with which one could finish the sentence "I am..." The relative masses reflect the relative importance of each representaiton to the self. For example, the large block might represent piano performances for a conert pianist while the small block would represent their favorite ice cream flavor. The linkages simulate what would happen when those representations are changed. If the concert pianist was convinced that they should not play piano (they injure their hands, they do not make enough money, someone trustworthy or some authority tells them they are terrible, etc.) then all the pieces of their self-concept would have to shift to accomdate this change. If they tried a new flavor of ice cream, mint chocolote chip, and realized it was better than their previous favorite flavor, (basic) chocolate, then this change would probably not result in a movement of the rest of their self-concept.

### Questions from Initial Sketches ###

What material should I use for the "spring"?

Do I only need one linkage between the servo motor and the small block? I should just need a simple cam-shaft.
